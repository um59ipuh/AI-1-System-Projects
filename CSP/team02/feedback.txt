Very good!
Since you managed to make all the constraints work: 5 bonus points.

Small tip for reducing nesting (some of your loops get really deeply nested):
Sometimes using `continue` for the negated conditions simplifies things.
Example:
Instead of
    for x in ...
        if isOkay(x):
            for y in ...:
                a = y.getSomething()
                if a is not None:
                    doStuff(a)
You could do:
    for x in ...
        if not isOkay(x):
            continue
        for y in ...:
            a = y.getSomething()
            if a is None:
                continue
            doStuff(a)

Status: passed
